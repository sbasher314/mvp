There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Daily Log / Tracker ##
#### A simple daily tracker for the average person ####
## Summary ##
This app streamlines the process of tracking and monitoring your mood or daily activities. With user-customizable colors, a simple user interface, and daily reminders, having a daily log has never been easier!

## Problem ##
Keeping a log of your daily activities and overall mood can be tedious and time-consuming to set up. You can't always rely on bringing a journal and pen with you everywhere, and that assumes that you have the space to store it.

## Solution ##
This minimalistic app takes out the complexity of keeping track of your daily activities and mood. There is no barrier to entry, and no issue with commitment. For those that are forgetful, we offer daily notifications to fill out your log.

  > Other apps are too cluttered, or too restricting in scope. We believe in flexibility without compromising simplicity. At the end of the day, you need something that will work for **you** - Steven Basher, project lead

## How to Get Started ##
All it takes to get started is to simply load up the app and you have everything you need to go already there! By default, we start you off with a simple mood tracker but it is quite extendable.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I could never commit to keeping a paper journal for tracking my daily activities, but with the convenience of this app it takes no time at all!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
If this sounds like a product you would like to use, all you have to do is visit the site and get started!
